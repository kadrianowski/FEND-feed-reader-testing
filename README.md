# Feed Reader Testing | Udacity FEND Nanodegree | 2018
Project 5 for Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree course

## What's this project about?

In this project there is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/ "click me") and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

## Getting started

* Clone the repository to create a copy on your local machine. Here's how to do it: [GitHub Help â€” Clone a Repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/ "click me")

* Open the `index.html` file in your browser or open it with your favorite editor.

* On the bottom of the app, Jasmine displays all the tests. All are green right now!

## Special thanks

This wouldn't be possible without StackOverflow, great people of internet and Headspace meditation app.
